# Code-Quiz
module 4 challenge

tried a new way of organizing my code and linking it all together in the end. Helped keep me more organized with what I wanted
each page to do, but the "linking" portion of it all was a bit more difficult to do. Will be keeping all my code contained
within 1 file moving forward.
